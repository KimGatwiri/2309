## Introduction to Version Control

### What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing developers to track progress, revert to previous versions, and collaborate efficiently. It is essential for software development, ensuring that multiple contributors can work on a project without conflicts.

### Types of Version Control Systems
- **Local Version Control:** Stores file versions locally on a developer’s machine.
- **Centralized Version Control (CVCS):** Uses a central server to store all versions of files, e.g., Subversion (SVN).
- **Distributed Version Control (DVCS):** Allows every contributor to have a complete copy of the repository, e.g., Git and Mercurial.

### Benefits of Version Control
- Tracks history of changes.
- Facilitates collaboration among multiple developers.
- Enables rollback to previous versions.
- Helps resolve conflicts in team projects.
- Supports branching and merging for parallel development.

## Working with Git

### What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)** that enables efficient collaboration and tracking of changes in source code. Unlike centralized systems, Git allows every user to have a local copy of the entire repository.

### Installing Git
- **Windows:** Download from [Git’s official site](https://git-scm.com/) and install.
- **Mac:** Use Homebrew: `brew install git`
- **Linux:** Use package managers like `apt` or `yum`:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install git  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install git  # CentOS/Fedora
  ```

### Setting Up SSH for GitHub
Using SSH for GitHub authentication is more secure and avoids repeated credential entry.

#### 1. Check for Existing SSH Keys
```sh
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
If you see `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have a key.

#### 2. Generate a New SSH Key (If Needed)
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
```
If `ed25519` is not available, use:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
Press **Enter** to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

#### 3. Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent
```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

#### 4. Add SSH Key to GitHub
Copy the public key:
```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Go to **GitHub** → **Settings** → **SSH and GPG Keys** → **New SSH Key**. Paste and save.

#### 5. Test the Connection
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If successful, you'll see:
> "Hi <your-username>! You've successfully authenticated."

#### 6. Use SSH for Git Operations
Clone repositories using SSH:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/repository.git
```
For existing repositories:
```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/repository.git
```

### Basic Git Workflow
- **Configure Git (First-Time Setup):**
  ```sh
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
- **Initialize a Repository:**
  ```sh
  git init
  ```
- **Check Repository Status:**
  ```sh
  git status
  ```
- **Add Files to Staging Area:**
  ```sh
  git add filename   # Add a specific file
  git add .          # Add all files
  ```
- **Commit Changes:**
  ```sh
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```
- **View Commit History:**
  ```sh
  git log
  ```

### Working with Git Branches
#### What are Branches?
A branch in Git is an independent line of development that allows developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

#### Common Branch Commands
- **Create a New Branch:**
  ```sh
  git branch feature-branch
  ```
- **Switch Branches:**
  ```sh
  git checkout feature-branch
  ```
- **List All Branches:**
  ```sh
  git branch
  ```
- **Delete a Branch:**
  ```sh
  git branch -d feature-branch
  ```
- **Merge Branches:**
  ```sh
  git checkout main
  git merge feature-branch
  ```

### Writing Good Git Commit Messages
- Use a short, clear summary in the first line (50 characters max).
- Add a more detailed description below if necessary.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug in authentication").
- Reference issue numbers when applicable (e.g., "Fix login bug #42").
- Keep commits focused on a single change or feature.

## Working with GitHub

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides Git repository hosting, collaboration tools, and CI/CD integration.

### Creating a GitHub Repository
- Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Click **New Repository**.
- Name your repository and select public or private.
- Initialize with a `README.md` if needed.
- Click **Create Repository**.

### Connecting Local Git to GitHub
- **Add a Remote Repository:**
  ```sh
  git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/repository.git
  ```
- **Push Changes to GitHub:**
  ```sh
  git push -u origin main
  ```
- **Pull Changes from GitHub:**
  ```sh
  git pull origin main
  ```
- **Cloning a Repository:**
  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:yourusername/repository.git
  ```

### Working with Pull Requests
- **Fork a Repository (if contributing to an external project).**
- **Create a Branch for Changes.**
- **Make Changes and Commit.**
- **Push Changes to GitHub.**
- **Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.**
- **Review and Merge PRs.**

## Working with GitHub Desktop

### What is GitHub Desktop?
GitHub Desktop is a GUI tool that simplifies Git and GitHub interactions without using the command line.

### Installing GitHub Desktop
- Download GitHub Desktop from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
- Install and sign in with your GitHub account.

### Basic GitHub Desktop Workflow
- **Clone a Repository:**
  - Open GitHub Desktop and click **Clone Repository**.
  - Choose a repository and select a local directory.
- **Create a Branch:**
  - Click **Current Branch > New Branch**.
  - Enter a branch name and create.
- **Make Changes and Commit:**
  - Modify files in the project folder.
  - Open GitHub Desktop, see changes, and click **Commit to Branch**.
- **Publish Branch to GitHub:**
  - Click **Push Origin**.
- **Create a Pull Request:**
  - Click **Create Pull Request** on GitHub Desktop.
  - Complete the PR details and submit.

## Conclusion
Understanding version control and Git is essential for modern software development.
